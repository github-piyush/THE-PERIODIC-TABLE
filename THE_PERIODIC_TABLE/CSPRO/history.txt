FIRST PERIODIC TABLE : was developed by Russian chemist Dimitri
                       Ivanovich Mendeleev in February 1869. This draft  
                       shows groups of elements  arranged horizontally 
                       rather than in the more familiar vertical 
                       columns.
                       Mendeleev produced many tables of both kinds.


NEWLANDS called “the law of octaves.” : In his original table, Newlands left
					empty spaces for missing elements, but
					his more publicized version of 1866 did
					not include these open slots. Other
					chemists immediately raised objections
					to the table because it would not be
					able to accommodate any new elements
					that might be discovered. 



THE MODERN PERIODIC TABLE :             Chemist Julius Lothar Meyer of Breslau
					University in Germany, while
					in the process of revising his chemistry
   textbook in 1868, produced a periodic similar to Mendeleev’s famous 1869
   version—although Lothar Meyer failed to classify all the elements correctly. But
   the table did not appear in print until 1870 because of a publisher’s delay—a
   factor that contributed to an acrimonious dispute for priority that ensued
   between Lothar Meyer and Mendeleev. Around the same time, Mendeleev
   assembled his own periodic table while he, too, was writing a textbook of chemistry.
   Unlike his predecessors, Mendeleev had sufficient confidence in his periodic
   table to use it to predict several new elements and the properties of their
   compounds. He also corrected the atomic weights of some already known elements.
   Interestingly, Mendeleev admitted to having seen certain earlier tables,
   such as those of Newlands, but claimed to have been unaware of Lothar Meyer’s
   work when developing his chart.
